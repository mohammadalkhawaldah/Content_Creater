Today we’re kicking off a new content workflow. The goal is to turn long conversations into clear, high‑impact posts.
We’ll extract key points, highlight memorable quotes, and end with strong calls to action.
The process is simple: transcribe, clean up, summarize, and create platform‑ready drafts.
Consistency and clarity matter most, so we keep the language direct and actionable.
By the end, the team can publish faster without losing quality.
